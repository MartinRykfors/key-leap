;;; Commentary:

;; key-leap-mode allows you to quickly jump to any visible line in a
;; window.  When key-leap-mode is enabled, it will populate the margin
;; of every line with an unique keyword.  By calling the interactive
;; command `key-leap-start-matching' the keywords become active.
;; Typing the keyword of a line in this state will move the point to
;; the beginning of that line.

;; You can change the way key-leap-mode generates its keys by setting
;; the variable `key-leap-key-strings'.  This is a list of strings
;; that specify what chars to use for each position in the keys.  For
;; example, adding this to your init file
;;
;; (setq key-leap-key-chars '("htn" "ao" "ht"))
;;
;; will make key-leap-mode generate and use the following keys:
;; hah hat hoh hot tah tat toh tot nah nat noh not

;; You are not restricted to just three-letter keywords.  By providing
;; 4 different strings, for instance, key-leap will use 4 letters for
;; every keyword.

;; You should provide a large enough number of different characters
;; for key-leap to use.  The number of combinations of characters
;; should be bigger than the number of possible visible lines for your
;; setup, but not too much bigger than that.

;; By default, key-leap-mode will generate 125 keywords from the
;; home-row of a qwerty keyboard layout, in a right-left-right
;; fashion.

;; When calling `key-leap-start-matching' it will run the hooks
;; `key-leap-before-leap-hook' and `key-leap-after-leap-hook'. For
;; instance, to make key-leap-mode move to indentation after leaping,
;; add the following to your config:
;;
;; (add-hook 'key-leap-after-leap-hook 'back-to-indentation)

;; When set to nil, `key-leap-upcase-active' will not make the active
;; parts of the keys upper-cased.  The default is t.

;; The faces for the active and inactive parts of the keys are
;; specified by the faces `key-leap-active' and `key-leap-inactive'
;; respectively.

;; Key-leap can be integrated with `evil-mode' by adding the function
;; `key-leap-create-evil-motion' to your Emacs config.  This creates
;; an evil motion called `key-leap-evil-motion'.  It works the same
;; way as `key-leap-start-matching', but it will also work with evil
;; features like operators, visual state and the jump list.  Please
;; see the documentation for `key-leap-create-evil-motion' for more
;; information.
